# hello-world
This is my first repository. I still do not know what to put in it. But I will put sth. ... I AM LEARNING 
Okay... This is Housam... I feel a bit awkward ... something like a ROBOT, since I am just doing what I have been told by an article.
The other problem I am having right now, is that I noticed that there is no check-spelling service here ðŸ˜²
So I may have made some terrible mistakes. 
But it is okay
I will learn to be OKAY with making mistakes
